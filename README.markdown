This is a repo of the LaTeX styles that I've built up over the years.

Depending what it's used for, some (especially macros-363) of this might not be useful.

### Included examples:
* report.tex
* article.tex

### texcount.pl
This utility will spit out a word count and can be set to trawl through
a hierarchy of included files
